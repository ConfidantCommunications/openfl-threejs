/**
	This class is an alternative to {@link THREE.Clock} with a different API design and behavior
	The goal is to avoid the conceptual flaws that became apparent in {@link THREE.Clock} over time.
	
	- {@link Timer} has an {@link .update()} method that updates its internal state. That makes it possible to call
	   {@link .getDelta()} and {@link .getElapsed()} multiple times per simulation step without getting different values.
	- The class can make use of the Page Visibility API to avoid large time delta values when the app is inactive (e.g.
	   tab switched or browser hidden).
